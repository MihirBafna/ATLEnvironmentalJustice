Barrow county, a county in metro Atlanta that resides a good distance from the center of the city, is slightly recognizable due to its higher percentage of hispanic population than average which comes out to about 10 percent. Barrow county is home of a very large state park named Fort Yargo. Therefore, the pollutants that comes from local business in the local city of Winder is often thoroughly managed in order to ensure that this park is safe enough to pass federal and state requirements of contaminants to swim in its lake. But this water is not always the safest, and minorites who are more likely to go there because they are poorer and cannot afford household swimming pools or community passes to pools are at greater risk to the toxic runoff.
