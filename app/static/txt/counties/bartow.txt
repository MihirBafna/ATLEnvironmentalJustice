Since 2008, Bartow county, a county on the outskirts of metro Atlanta, has had close to no PM2.5, air pollution that is emitted from fuel-burning vehicles and power plants. These particles are so small that can travel through airways into the bloodstream and can raise the risk of heart attacks, asthma, and other lung infections. People in Bartow county are also very active, as seen in their high walkability.
