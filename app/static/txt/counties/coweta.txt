Coweta County, a county on the southern outskirts of metropolitan Atlanta, has a population of 148,509 people. It has 56,539 housing units and has a percentage of poverty of 10.2%. Recently the Georgia House and Natural Resources and Environment made it to where it was not required for residents of the county to be notified of toxic wastes being emptied into the surrounding areas. One of the largest concerns is Coal Ash coming from nearby manufacturing plants such as Georgia Power. The companies claim they are doing more than enough but these water concerns could impact poorer communities that rely on cheap local water sources for their homes.
