Ranking third in Income per capita, Fayette is one of the only three counties to not have any environmental hotspots. Non-coincidentally, a very high percentage of its population is white. This area is largely known for its close proximity to the airports, which is one of the well-known contributors to airpollution because large Jets and Airplanes burn an absolute ridiculous amount of fuel. In addition,  It is also rich in office buildings and manufacturing plants which contributes to its source of pollutants into the air. This is most likely the reason for the slightly high air quality index in such a wealthy area.
