Legislators from DeKalb county, a county in the center of Georgia, have recently been asking the Georgia Environmental Protection Division to revoke the solid waste permit of the company Metro Green Recycling Three, LCC. This company has been trying to build a plant in a residential community in Stonecrest. This action goes against Dekalb County’s Solid Waste Management Plan, which only allows the county to take care of waste or recycling; no other entity can do so. It also amounts to environmental racism, for that part of the city is primarily African American. The county is determined to prevent this community from “becoming a dumping ground for solid waste handling facilities once again”.
