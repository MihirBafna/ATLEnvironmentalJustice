Spalding county is located directly south of Atlanta. In 2011, Spaulding county recently faced environmental challenges while building a new airport in the area. The replacement airport had two potential locations. One location would have a large amount of environmental concerns and the other would just simply not be as optimal of a location. This decision would negatively affect people in the area surrounding the first option. Luckily, it appears that they ended up deciding with the alternative that would have fewer impacts on the environment. The county has also had issues related to environmental justice because methane from local cows is resulting in worse air quality in poorer areas.
