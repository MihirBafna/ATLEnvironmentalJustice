Newton county is located southeast of Atlanta and, as shown on the graph, it is one of the poorest counties in metropolitan Atlanta and has one of the highest percentage of African Americans living in the area. It also tends to have troubles when it comes to the environment. Its capital city, Covington happens to contain many manufacturing plants and business offices. Recently, there have been concerns related to pollutants coming out of these facilities, particularly related to a chemical called ethylene oxide. Although, little has been done about this because the EPAâ€™s requirements have been met. However, this area continues to be on the watchlist because pollution from these factories is an enormous concern.
