Fulton county is in the center of metro Atlanta. In Central Fulton, the Grove Park neighborhood has been the home to an upstanding large African American population, with high housing values and high school graduation rates. However, in this same area, there are many pollution points: the compressed natural gas Marta Station near the neighborhood repeatedly violating its Clean Air Act permit recently and the nearby Woodall Creek Site has been classified by the EPD as a Class I HSI site, highly prioritized for the potential of hazardous release, because four different toxins were released into the groundwater.
