In Central Douglas, a county in southwestern Atlanta, there are many pollution sites thanks to the Signal Energy Holdings Corporation. It violated RCRA multiple times by failing to properly handle hazardous waste at its Douglasville facility. Also in this area is the Arivec Chemicals facility that is a Class HSI site because of the lead it releases that ultimately contaminates the groundwater. This part of Douglas is home to schools that are close to these plants and has a large minority population.
